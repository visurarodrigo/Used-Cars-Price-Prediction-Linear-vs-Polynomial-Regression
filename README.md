## 🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction: Linear vs Polynomial Regression

This project focuses on modeling used car prices using **Linear** and **Polynomial Regression** techniques.

### Objectives

- Explore the relationship between car attributes (e.g., engine size, highway-mpg, horsepower) and price.
- Build and compare:
  - 📐 **Simple Linear Regression**
  - 📈 **Polynomial Regression**
- Evaluate model performance using **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Visualize fitted values vs actual price data.

### Technologies Used

- Python 3 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `sklearn` (scikit-learn)

### 📂 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Used-Cars-Price-Prediction.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with full implementation |
| `README.md` | Project overview |
| `Plots` | Saved charts and plots |
| `usedcars.csv` | Data Set |

### 📊 Key Insights

- Polynomial regression provided a better fit for non-linear data trends.
- Pipelines simplified model building with multiple steps.
- Visualization helped interpret model predictions effectively.
